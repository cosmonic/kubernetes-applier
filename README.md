> [!IMPORTANT]
This repository is **deprecated**. The functionality provided by Kubernetes Applier has been moved to the [`wasmcloud-operator`](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wasmcloud-operator), we strongly recommend you use the [wasmCloud Operator](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wasmcloud-operator) instead.

# Kubernetes applier

This repo contains the interface, provider, and basic service actor for a Kubernetes applier. This
is mainly intended for use with those who need to connect existing Kubernetes services to services
in wasmCloud. Please see each individual directory for more information
